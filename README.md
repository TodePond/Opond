# OPOND

## What is this?

This is my 24 month transition towards using free-open-source-software for everything I use. It began on the 30th July 2023. It ended on the 30th July 2025.

And I was successful. Right now, *everything I use is open-source*.

## Why?

There were many reasons. Are you sure you want me to list them all? It's quite long.

## Yes, I promise I'll read them all

Ok, here you go. Here's why I switched to free-open-source everything:

todo: write the reasons

# START

The first job was to document everything I currently used. Here's a start...

My use of software could be split into three categories.

1. For my personal use.
2. For my TodePond work.
3. For my tldraw work.
